While reading Kotlin documentation is easy and pleasant, learning everything by example is a different kind of fun.
This is an official set of small and simple annotated examples designed for those new to Kotlin.
No prior knowledge of any programming language is required.

You can run each snippet of code, check the result, and then run it again. Learn and play!
